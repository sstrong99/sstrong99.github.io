<p class="text">Steve Strong is a postdoctoral researcher at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago. Steve received his undergraduate training at the Colorado School of Mines. He completed his Ph.D. research at the University of Colorado Boulder under the direction of Prof. Joel Eaves. There, he used molecular dynamics simulations to study a variety of systems with applications ranging from solar energy to water purification. He developed a new method for atomistic simulation of nonequilibrium steady-state flow. While at CU, Steve received an NSF graduate research fellowship and served as Chair of the 2017 Gordon Research Conference on the Physics and Chemistry of Liquids. After earning his Ph.D. in 2017, Steve joined the Skinner group, where he uses computer simulation and theoretical spectroscopy to understand the complex behaviors and dynamics of condensed phase systems. He also serves as a co-organizer for the University of Chicago <a href="https://compinsci.psd.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computations in Science Seminar</a>.</p>
